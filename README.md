# Empy

Empy is a plugin for a wide range of lossy distortion sounds, drawing inspiration from lossy audio compression codecs like MP3. Empy can sound bubbly and metallic. It can resemble a bitcrusher. It can freeze sound at spots, like a choppy phone connection. An any setting, Empy gives sound distinctive lossy distortion.

I made Empy as a part of my undergraduate thesis at the University of Oregon.
